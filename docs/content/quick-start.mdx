## Setup in 3 Steps

Setup your form in just 3 steps:
- Create an account
- Create a form
- Connect your frontend form

> Now you can start receiving submissions instantly — view, filter, or export them from your dashboard.

---

### Step 1: Create an Account

1. Go to [FormSync.app](https://formsync.app)
2. Sign up using your **email** or **Google** account.
3. Once logged in, you'll land on your **Dashboard**.

---

### Step 2: Create a New Form

1. Click on **“Create New Form”** in your dashboard.
2. Enter basic details like:
   - **Form Name** (e.g., Contact Form)
   - **Redirect URL** (optional — for thank-you pages)
   - **Notification Email** (optional)
3. Click **Create Form** — and you'll get a **unique endpoint URL** like:

> `https://formsync.app/v1/s/YOUR_FORM_ID`


This is your form’s submission endpoint.

---

### Step 3: Connect Your Frontend Form

You can now use that endpoint directly in your form.  
Here’s a simple **HTML example**:

```html
<form action="https://formsync.app/v1/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

When someone submits this form, the data will automatically appear in your **FormSync Dashboard**.

---

### Step 4: View Submissions

Go to your **Dashboard → Forms → [Find Form] → View Submissions**
Here you can:

- View all received entries
- Filter or search by date
- Export as CSV
