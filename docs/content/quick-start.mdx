## Setup in 3 Steps

Setup your form in just 3 steps:
- [Create an account](#step-1-create-an-account)
- [Create a form](#step-2-create-a-new-form)
- [Connect your frontend form](#step-3-connect-your-frontend-form)
- [View submissions](#step-4-view-submissions)

> Now you can start receiving submissions instantly in your **FormSync Dashboard**.

---

### Step 1: Create an Account

1. Go to [formsync.app](https://formsync.app)
2. Sign up using your **email**
3. Navigate to your **Dashboard**

---

### Step 2: Create a New Form

1. Click on **Forms** in sidebar
2. Click **Create a New Form**
3. Enter basic details like:
   - **Form Title** (e.g., Contact Form)
   - **Form Description** (e.g., Get in touch with us)
4. Click **Create New Form** — and you'll get a **unique endpoint URL** like:


> `https://api.formsync.app/v1/s/YOUR_FORM_ID`


This is your form’s submission endpoint.

> You can publish your form by clicking on **Publish Form** button.

To publish your form, you need to build form in FormSync editor and then copy the form public URL.

---

### Step 3: Connect Your Frontend Form

You can now use that endpoint directly in your form.  
Here’s a simple **HTML example**:

```html
<form action="https://api.formsync.app/v1/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

When someone submits this form, the data will automatically appear in your **FormSync Dashboard**.

---

### Step 4: View Submissions

Go to your **Dashboard → Forms → [Click on Form] → View Submissions**
Here you can:

- View all received entries
