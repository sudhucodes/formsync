- [Create an account](#step-1-create-an-account)
- [Create a form](#step-2-create-a-new-form)

### Step 1: Create an Account

1. Go to [FormSync.app](https://formsync.app)
2. Sign up using your **email**
3. Navigate to your **Dashboard**

---

### Step 2: Create a New Form

1. Click on **Forms** in sidebar
2. Click **Create a New Form**
3. Enter basic details like:
   - **Form Title** (e.g., Contact Form)
   - **Form Description** (optional)
   - **Form Origns** (optional)
4. Add your **form fields** like:
   - **Name** (e.g., Name)
   - **Email** (e.g., Email)
   - **Message** (e.g., Message)
5. Click **Create New Form** — and you'll get a **unique endpoint URL** like:

> `https://formsync.app/v1/s/YOUR_FORM_ID`


This is your form’s submission endpoint.

---

### Step 3: Connect Your Frontend Form

You can now use that endpoint directly in your form.  
Here’s a simple **HTML example**:

```html
<form action="https://formsync.app/v1/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

When someone submits this form, the data will automatically appear in your **FormSync Dashboard**.

---

### Step 4: View Submissions

Go to your **Dashboard → Forms → [Find Form] → View Submissions**
Here you can:

- View all received entries
