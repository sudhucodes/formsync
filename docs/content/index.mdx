## Overview

FormSync is a **backend-free** form handling platform that helps developers collect and manage form submissions without building or maintaining a server.

Built on top of MongoDB, FormSync ensures reliability, security and scalability. You can integrate it easily with any frontend technology - including HTML, React, Next.js or any framework that supports `HTTP POST` requests.

---

## How It Works

1. You create a form in your FormSync dashboard.
2. You copy your unique form endpoint (e.g., `https://api.formsync.app/v1/s/<form_id>`).
3. You add it to your frontend form’s `action` attribute and change the method to `POST`.
4. That’s it! You’re ready to receive submissions instantly.

> You can view all submissions in your **FormSync Dashboard**.

## Live Example

A simple HTML integration:

```html
<form action="https://api.formsync.app/v1/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

This sends data directly to your FormSync form endpoint — no backend or database setup needed.
You can view all submissions in your **FormSync Dashboard**.
