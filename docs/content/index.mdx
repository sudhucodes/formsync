<CallOut text="We are currently in BETA v1.2.0 — Please avoid using this version in production." type="warning" />

## Overview

FormSync is a **backend-free** form handling platform that helps developers collect and manage form submissions **without building or maintaining a server**.

Built on top of **MongoDB**, FormSync ensures reliability, security, and scalability. You can integrate it easily with any frontend technology — including **HTML**, **React**, **Next.js**, or any framework that supports **HTTP POST** requests.

---

### How It Works

1. **Create a form** in your FormSync dashboard.  
2. **Copy your unique form endpoint** (e.g., `https://formsync.app/v1/s/<form_id>`).  
3. **Add it to your frontend form’s `action` attribute** or use our API with your key.  
4. **Start receiving submissions instantly** — view, filter, or export them from your dashboard.

### Key Features

- **Backend-Free** — No servers, databases, or APIs to set up manually.  
- **Secure & Spam-Protected** — All submissions are validated and protected against spam.  
- **Scalable & Reliable** — Built on MongoDB, optimized for performance and uptime.  
- **Developer-Friendly** — Works seamlessly with any tech stack or static site.  
- **Instant Analytics** — Get insights like submission trends and user device info.

### Live Example

A simple HTML integration:

```html
<form action="https://formsync.app/v1/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

This sends data directly to your FormSync form endpoint — no backend or database setup needed.
You can view all submissions in your **FormSync Dashboard**.

> More framework-specific examples (React, Next.js, etc.) will be added soon.
