## Authentication

All requests must include your **API key** in the `Authorization` header.

```http
Authorization: Bearer fs_your_api_key_here
```

### Important Notes

* API keys are shown **only once**
* Store them securely
* Regenerate if lost or leaked

> If a valid API key is not provided in the request header, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` error.
