## Install the Package

Install the FormSync package using your preferred package manager:

You can install the package using `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun` like this

```bash
npm install formsync
```

### Please Note

FormSync is currently in development. We are actively working on improving the package. If you face any issues or have feedback, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/sudhucodes/formsync/issues).

## Create an Instance

To create an instance of FormSync, you need to pass the following parameters:

- `formId`: The unique form ID you received after creating the form.
- `redirectUrl`: The URL you want to redirect users to after submission.

```jsx
import { FormSync } from "formsync";

const formSync = new FormSync({
    formId: "YOUR_FORM_ID",
    redirectUrl: "https://yourwebsite.com/thank-you",
});
```

> For now use FormSync in React / Next.js like your regular HTML forms.

Our package is currently in development. When it's ready, you'll be able to use it like this:

```jsx
import { FormSync } from "formsync";

function App() {
    const formSync = new FormSync({
        formId: "YOUR_FORM_ID",
        redirectUrl: "https://yourwebsite.com/thank-you",
    });

    return (
        <form action={formSync.submit} method="POST">
            <input 
                type="text"
                name="name" 
                placeholder="Your name"
                required
            />
            <input 
                type="email" 
                name="email" 
                placeholder="Your email"
                required
            />
            <textarea 
                name="message" 
                placeholder="Your message" 
                required
            ></textarea>
            <button type="submit">Send</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

## That’s It!

Once your form is live:

- Form submissions will appear in your FormSync dashboard.
- No backend, JavaScript, or server-side code is required.
- You can integrate the same way with any static site, portfolio, or landing page.
