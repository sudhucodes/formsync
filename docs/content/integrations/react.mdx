title: React / Next.js Integration
description: Use FormSync with React and Next.js using the built-in FormSyncForm and FormSyncButton components.
---

## Install the Package

Install FormSync using your preferred package manager:

```package-install
formsync
```

You can also use `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun`.

---

## Please Note

FormSync is currently in development. We are actively working on improving the package. If you face any issues or have feedback, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/sudhucodes/formsync/issues).

---

## Basic Usage with React / Next.js

FormSync now provides a **React-first API** using the `FormSyncForm` component.
You no longer need to manually create an instance or use the `action` attribute.

> You can still use the `action` attribute if you prefer, but it is not recommended in React.

### Example

```jsx
import { FormSyncForm } from "formsync";
import { toast } from "react-toast-msg";

export default function Example() {
    return (
        <main>
            <FormSyncForm
                formId="YOUR_FORM_ID"
                onSuccess={(res) => toast.success(res.message)}
                onSubmitError={(err) => toast.error(err.message)}
            >
                <input
                    type="text"
                    name="name"
                    placeholder="Name"
                    required
                />
                <button type="submit">
                    Submit
                </button>
            </FormSyncForm>
        </main>
    );
}
```

## Handling Form States

### Success Callback

The `onSuccess` prop is triggered when the form submission is successful.

```jsx
onSuccess={(res) => {
    console.log(res.message);
}}
```

### Error Callback

The `onSubmitError` prop is triggered if the submission fails.

```jsx
onSubmitError={(err) => {
    console.error(err.message);
}}
```

Both callbacks receive a structured response object from FormSync.

### FormSyncForm Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `formId` | `string` | `true` | Your unique Form ID from the dashboard. |
| `onSuccess` | `function` | `false` | Callback triggered on successful submission. |
| `onSubmitError` | `function` | `false` | Callback triggered when submission fails. |
| `className` | `string` | `false` | Custom CSS classes for the form element. |

---

## Loading State with FormSyncButton

If you want a built-in loading state for your submit button, use `FormSyncButton`.

### Example

```jsx
import { FormSyncForm, FormSyncButton } from "formsync";

<FormSyncForm formId="YOUR_FORM_ID">
    <input name="name" required />
    <input type="email" name="email" required />
    <textarea name="message" required />

    <FormSyncButton
        loadingText="Submitting..."
        className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
    >
        Submit
    </FormSyncButton>
</FormSyncForm>
```

### FormSyncButton Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `loadingText` | `string` | `false` | Text to display while submitting (defaults to "Loading..."). |
| `className` | `string` | `false` | Custom CSS classes for the button. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Manually disable the button. |

### What FormSyncButton Does

* Automatically disables the button during submission
* Shows `loadingText` while the form is submitting
* Re-enables the button after completion

No extra state management is required.

## That’s It 🎉

Once your form is live:

* Submissions appear instantly in your FormSync dashboard
* No backend or API routes are needed
* Works seamlessly with React, Next.js, and static sites

You can now focus entirely on your UI while FormSync handles the rest.
