## Create an HTML Form

To connect your form with FormSync:

- Set the `action` to your unique FormSync endpoint.
- Use the `POST` method.
- Add the `name` attribute to each input so FormSync can collect the data.
- Use `required` attributes if you want to enforce validation in the browser.

**Example:**

```html
<form 
    action="https://api.formsync.app/v1/s/<your-form-id>"
    method="POST"
>
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" required />
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required />
    <button type="submit">
        Submit
    </button>
</form>
```

> FormSync accepts any standard HTML form as long as the `action` and `method` are correctly configured.

## Redirect After Submission (Optional)

If you want users to be redirected to a thank-you page after submission, you can add:

FormSync will automatically redirect users to the URL specified in the `value` attribute.

```html
<input 
    type="hidden" 
    name="_redirect" 
    value="https://yourwebsite.com/thank-you" 
/>
```

> Note: If you don't specify a redirect URL, FormSync will redirect users to the default [Thank You Page](https://formsync.app/thank-you).

## That’s It!

Once your form is live:

- Form submissions will appear in your FormSync dashboard.
- No backend, JavaScript or server-side code is required.
- You can integrate the same way with any static site, portfolio or landing page.
