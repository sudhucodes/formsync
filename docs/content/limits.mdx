title: 'Limits'
description: "When you're building a form, you might want to limit the number of fields that can be added to the form. You can do this by setting the `maxFields` property on the form."
---

```tsx
import { useForm, useFormState } from "react-cool-form";

const App = () => {
    const { form, setValue } = useForm({
        maxFields: 3,
    });

    const { values } = useFormState(form);

    return (
        <form ref={form}>
            <input name="name" />
            <input name="email" />
            <input name="phone" />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};
```

## `maxFields`

The `maxFields` property accepts a number and it represents the maximum number of fields that can be added to the form.

```tsx
import { useForm, useFormState } from "react-cool-form";

const App = () => {
    const { form, setValue } = useForm({
        maxFields: 3,
    });

    const { values } = useFormState(form);

    return (
        <form ref={form}>
            <input name="name" />
            <input name="email" />
            <input name="phone" />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};
