## Create a Project in FormSync

1. Sign in to your FormSync dashboard at **formsync.app**.
2. Create a new project.
3. Copy the **Form Endpoint URL** generated for that project.  
   This URL will be used to submit form data.

---

## Add Action & Method

Use the endpoint URL in a standard HTML form.

```html
<form action="https://api.formsync.app/<your-endpoint>" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Using FormSync in React or Next.js (Coming Soon)

If you prefer to handle submission with JavaScript:

```js
async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    const formData = {
        name: e.target.name.value,
        email: e.target.email.value,
    };

    await fetch('https://formsync.app/v1/s/<your-form-id>', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    });
}
```
